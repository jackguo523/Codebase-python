    """Blind Richardson-Lucy deconvolution.
    Parameters
    ----------
    image : ndarray
       Input degraded image (can be N dimensional).
    psf : ndarray, optional
       A first estimate of the point spread function, same size as image
    iterations : int
       Number of iterations. This parameter plays the role of
       regularisation. After a given iterations, the estimates can produce
       division by 0 problems, then the algorithm is automatically stopped.
    return_iterations : boolean, optional
        Returns instead of a tuple of the final restorated image and used PSF
        a tuple of all iterations for further investigation
    clip : boolean, optional
       True by default. If true, pixel value of the result above 1 or
       under -1 are thresholded for skimage pipeline compatibility.
    Returns
    -------
    im_deconv : ndarray
       The deconvolved image.
    psf : ndarray
        The last PSF estimate to deconvolve image
    Examples
    --------
    >>> from skimage.restoration import blind_richardson_lucy
    >>> image = np.zeros((100,100))
    >>> im[40:60, 45:55] = 1
    >>> im[45:55, 40:60] = 1
    >>> psf = np.zeros_like(image)
    >>> psf[50,50] = 1
    >>> psf = gaussian(psf, 2)
    >>> image_conv = convolve2d(image, psf, 'same')
    >>> deconvolved, calc_psf = blind_richardson_lucy(image_conv, 10)
    Notes
    -----
    This function estimates a point spread function based on an inverse Richardson Lucy algorithm as described
    in Fish et al., 1995. It is an iterative process where the PSF and image is deconvolved, respectively.
    It is more noise tolerant than other algorithms, such as Ayers-Dainty and the Weiner filter algorithms (taken
    from the paper).
    The algorithm performs well with gaussian PSFs and can recover them nicely without any prior knowledge. If
    one has already an educated guess, one should pass the PSF as argument to the function.
    Note, that the PSF should have the same shape as the image, and the PSF should be centered.
    Due to its nature, the algorithm may divide by 0. The function catches this issue and aborts the iterative
    process. Mostly, the optimal number of iterations is before this error may occur.
